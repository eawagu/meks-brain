## Connection

Slack MCP (workspace-scoped). User ID for DM dispatch: U080PEXEZ0E. Tier 1 channels: #teamapt-tech-operations (C0ABU8GMW75), #account-switch-alerts (C098VUQCVRA), #teamapt-x-paystack-transfer-support (C096LCNP26P), #notifications-support-dev (C08PH35PLPK), #go-subscribe-by-teamapt (C090UHR9VDE).

## Directives

### Priority model
- Tier 1: listed channels above — read every tick.
- Tier 2: DMs mentioning the user — read every tick.
- Tier 3: keyword matches across public + private via `slack_search_public_and_private`.

### Keyword rules
- Primary: RC91, RC05, P1, outage, degraded, intermittent, failing, failure, down.
- Issuer names (always): Stanbic, Ecobank, Sterling, Polaris, Wema, NIBSS, PTSA, NUS, CoralPay, FCMB, Keystone, Access, UBA, Fidelity, Habari.

### Skip rules
- Ignore bot-only status pings that produce no delta vs. the last recorded state.
- Ignore messages in channels not listed above unless surfaced via keyword search.

### Sweep order (MUST execute in this order each tick)
1. **Read** all Tier 1 channel parent messages since last_processed — enumerate every new P1 filing, not only threads linked to existing situation pages. (Structural guard against the 2026-04-17 Wema miss.)
2. **Cross-check** any P1 filings from step 1 against existing situation pages — if untracked, create a new situation page.
3. **Read** DMs to user.
4. **Search** keyword matches (Tier 3) for the window.
5. **Per-message** salience reasoning + brain-wide similarity search.

### Known limitations
- `slack_search_public_and_private` with space-separated terms is AND-only. Use channel reads for authoritative coverage; use search only to confirm specific keyword presence.
- Rate-limiting on parallelized channel reads + searches. Retry once; continue the tick if persistent.
- Search index lag: recent messages often return zero even when surfaced via channel-read. Channel-read is authoritative.

## Notes

Tick 2026-04-18 12:09 WAT window (11:10 WAT → 12:09 WAT, Skim tick): **Zero Slack deltas across all Tier 1 channels.** #teamapt-tech-operations empty, DM channel empty, keyword sweep (P1 / outage / RC91 / RC05 after:2026-04-18) zero results. Evening-filed P1s from Apr 17 (Stanbic cycle 27, Polaris second cycle, UBA Apr 17) and overnight-filed Keystone RC05 + FCMB RC91 all remain silent on Slack — continuing absence of resolution signal. Re-dispatch suppressed per recurring-pattern calibration precedent (briefing-2026-04-17 16:30 triage, carried in briefing-2026-04-18 B6). Parent-message sweep structural guard performed as expected — no new filings missed this window.
